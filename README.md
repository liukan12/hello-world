# hello-world
my first code on github 
it's my first code written on github.all copyright will be free in this code named "hello-world"
i'm a beginner using github,hope it will solve my problem during the research work.
i'm a doctoral candinidate in the field of enviornment protection and focusing on the particle removal on the ceramic filter surface.
i usually use Fluent for my simulation tool to deal with the movement of the small particles in the filter,but it's hard now to publish a paper using just a single simulation software like fluent or openfoam.
so, i came here to find some brillant idead or code to simulate the formation and aggregattion of fine particles during filter operation.
if anyone is familiar with this field,please contact me at once.you will be warmly welcomed for your aid and kindly heart.
i'm interested in Fluent udf code and any simulation code for particle deposition or aggregate behavior.
i use C/C++ as my basic programming language,and also knew VB,MATLAB,plus a little JAVASCRIPT.
at future,my work will focus on the coupled simulation between Fluent and EDEM.
if you are good at EDEM, please email me at anytime,i'm eager to receive your email and weclome you to attend the conference setting at China.
wish you have good day.
